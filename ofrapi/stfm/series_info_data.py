    Keyword Args:
        start_date (str): First date in "YYYY-MM-DD" format for which you want to receive data. If no start_date is given, "1901-01-01" is used.
        end_date (str): Last date in "YYYY-MM-DD" format for which you want to receive data. If no end_date is given, today's date is used.
        periodicity (str): Converts the series to the given periodicity. Available values are: ["A", "AS", "D", "M", "MS", "W", "B", "BM", "BMS", "Q", "BQ", "QS", "BQS", "BA", "BAS"]

        remove_nulls (str): If this parameter is set to "true" all nulls in the series will be removed.
        time_format (str): The format for the dates in the series. By default they are returned as strings in the format: YYYY-MM-DD. Available values are: ["date", "ms"]
