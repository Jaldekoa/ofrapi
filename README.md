# ofrapi documentation
This repository contains a Python wrapper to easily retrieve data from the Office of Financial Research (OFR) in Pandas format using the official API.

## APIs of the Office of Financial Research (OFR)
- **[Short-term Funding Monitor: ofrapi.stfm](ofrapi/stfm/README.md)**
- **[Hedge Fund Monitor: ofrapi.hfm](ofrapi/hfm/README.md)**
- **[Bank Systemic Risk Monitor: ofrapi.bsrm](ofrapi/bsrm/README.md)**

## Installation
```commandline
pip install ofrapi
```

## Short-term Funding Monitor
The Short-term Funding Monitor (STFM) application programming interface (API) allows a remote application to query the Office of Financial Research for data without the need for a human intermediary to download data manually. While some API calls might be used every day, others are intended for use when setting up a remote application for a periodic refresh.

We have provided this open interface for public use. This API does not require tokens or registration, so feel free to use it immediately.
